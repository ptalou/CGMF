Discrete Levels
===============

The nuclear structure information needed to describe each fission fragment is obtained from the `RIPL-3 <https://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/>`_ library. Nuclear structure data are always evolving, depending on the availability of new nuclear structure experiments. CGMF does not calculate the excited states in a given nucleus, but instead fully depends on the `ENSDF <http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/ensdf/>`_ or somewhat equivalenty, RIPL3 libraries. The study of isomeric ratios or more generally specific $\gamma$ decay chains strongly depends on the quality of the underlying nuclear structure information. 

.. note:: The particular decay of a state in the continuum to discrete levels characterized by a particular (E,J,$\pi$) is an important question.
